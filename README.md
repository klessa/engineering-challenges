## Project Description
Imagine that One Technologies has just acquired a new company and their website.  We would like to continue using the existing website with the exception of replacing all customer service phone numbers of the old company with our own.  Your task is to write a console application that takes a directory as a single parameter and outputs a file with a list of all files in that directory that contain phone number with the format of either ###-###-#### or (###)###-####.  

Here's what your console application must do:

1. Your app must accept a single parameter indicating which directory to begin searching.  Bonus points if it handles local and UNC paths. 
1. Your app must search the given directory and any children for files that contain phone numbers.  
1. Your app must produce a .txt file with matching files including paths written on individual lines.
1. Your app must write to the console the total number of matching files and the total number of files searched.
1. Your app must be written in a .Net language (c#, VB.Net, f#) 

Your application does not need to:

1. Worry about authentication.  
1. Have unit tests (but bonus points if it does).

Your application should be easy to set up and should run on modern versions of Windows.  It should not require any for-pay software.  Nuget packages are perfectly acceptable.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria:

1. Did your application fulfill the basic requirements?
1. Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
